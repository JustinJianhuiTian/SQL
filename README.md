SQL Notes
==========

### Select top 3 without TOP/LIMIT/ROWNUM

Top 3 Quantity From OrdersDetails:
https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all

```sql
SELECT Quantity 
FROM OrderDetails a
where (select count(*) from OrderDetails b where b.Quantity >= a.Quantity) <= 3
order by Quantity desc
```
or 

```sql
SELECT Quantity, (select count(*) from OrderDetails b where b.Quantity >= a.Quantity) as rnk 
FROM OrderDetails a
where (select count(*) from OrderDetails b where b.Quantity >= a.Quantity) <= 3
order by Quantity desc
```
Note: 
  - COUNT acts on WHERE **b.Quantity >= a.Quantity** which is also aggregation condition 
  - Table self-join to be a condition
  - Use **select** to create a new column
  - The order of **b.Quantity > a.Quantity**
  - Pay attention to **>=** or **>**
  - No need to use **ORDER BY** when using **b.Quantity >= a.Quantity**
  - See below **Second Largest** for more explanation

### Self Join

Rank Scores

| Id | Score |
|----|-------|
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |

as

| Score | Rank |
|-------|------|
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 3.85  | 2    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.50  | 4    |

```sql
select a.Score, (select count(*) from (select distinct(Score) from Scores
order by Score desc) c where c.Score >= a.Score) as Rank
from (
select Score from Scores
order by Score desc) a
```

[Rank Quantity](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all) 

```sql
select a.Quantity, (select count(*) from (select distinct(Quantity) from OrderDetails
order by Quantity desc) c where c.Quantity >= a.Quantity) as Rank
from (
select Quantity from OrderDetails
order by Quantity desc) a
```

or,

```sql
select c.Quantity, sub3.rnk as rank from OrderDetails c
join
(select sub1.Quantity, (select count(*) from (SELECT distinct(Quantity) FROM OrderDetails) sub2 where sub2.Quantity >= sub1.Quantity) as rnk 
from 
(SELECT distinct(Quantity) FROM OrderDetails) sub1) sub3
on c.Quantity = sub3.Quantity
order by Rank asc
```

Note:
  - **self join** is very powerfull. 
  - Use **select count(*) from table a where c.Score >= a.Score** to create a new column
  
### Second Largest 

Using **LIMIT**

```sql
SELECT number
FROM (
SELECT number FROM Table
ORDER BY number desc limit 2
) ORDER BY number limit 1
```

or Using **TOP**

```sql
SELECT TOP 1 salary   
FROM (  
SELECT TOP 2 salary  
FROM employee_table  
ORDER BY salary DESC) AS emp  
ORDER BY salary ASC;
```

or Using **LIMIT** and **OFFSET**
```sql
SELECT OrderID, Quantity FROM OrderDetails
Order By Quantity desc
Limit 1 Offset 1
```

Note:
  - **LIMIT/TOP/OFFSET** are not always available; they are not basis SQL commands. 

Using **max()** and **not in ()**

```sql
select max(Quantity) from OrderDetails
where Quantity not in (select max(Quantity) from OrderDetails)
```

Notes:
  - **column IN (1,2,3)** / **column NOT IN (select id from table)**

Using **self join**

```sql
select Quantity from OrderDetails a
where (select count(*) from OrderDetails b where b.Quantity > a.Quantity) = 1
```

or 
```sql
SELECT OrderID, Quantity FROM OrderDetails a
where (select count(*) from OrderDetails b where b.Quantity >= a.Quantity) = 2
```

Interpretation of this SQL Query:

  - Select **a.Quantity** in **OrderDetails a** and for each **b.Quantity** compare to this **a.Quantity**
  - Count the number where **b.Quantity >= a.Quantity** for each record aggregately
  - The first three largest **a.Quantity**: 120, 100, 90 
  - ```sql
    select count(*) from OrderDetails b where b.Quantity >= 120
    ```
	return 1
	
  - ```sql
	select count(*) from OrderDetails b where b.Quantity >= 100
	```
    return 2
	
  - ```sql
	select count(*) from OrderDetails b where b.Quantity >= 90
	```
    return 3

### Maximun in each group

Using **rank() over()**

```sql
RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY column_ID ORDER BY column_ID) AS rank_id
```

Other similar queries:
```sql
row_number() over(order by customer_atg_id) as record_id
```

[Maximun Quantity in each of the *OrderID*:](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all)

```sql
SELECT OrderDetailID, OrderID, max(Quantity) FROM OrderDetails
group by OrderID
```

Note: 
  - **MAX** acts on each of the group, similarly as **MIN**, **SUM**, etc. 
  - In some database, this query will not work as **OrderDetailID** is not in **group by**.
    - In [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all), it works.
  
### Between Date

*OrderID* between *'1996-09-02'* and *'1996-09-06'*:
https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all

```sql
SELECT OrderID, OrderDate FROM Orders
WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN '1996-09-02' AND '1996-09-06'
```

Note:
  - **BETWEEN ... AND ...** is inclusive.

or 

```sql
SELECT OrderID, OrderDate FROM Orders
WHERE OrderDate >= '1996-09-02' AND OrderDate <= '1996-09-06'
```

### Left Join

Left Join **Orders** on **Shippers**
https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all

```sql
SELECT a.OrderID, a.ShipperID, b.ShipperName FROM Orders a
Left join Shippers b
on a.ShipperID = b.ShipperID
```

Note:
  - **left join** fills all the records in “left table” with matches on “right table”
  

Left Join **Shippers** on **Orders**
https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all

```sql
SELECT a.ShipperID, ShipperName, OrderID, OrderDate
FROM Shippers a
LEFT JOIN Orders b
ON a.ShipperID = b.ShipperID
```

Note:
  - If there are multiply copies in the ‘right table’ matching the ‘left table’. The ‘left table’ matched item will duplicate to have multiply copies.
  - There is no difference between ‘left join’ and ‘join’ if there is no ‘missing’ on the join condition element(s) in the two tables. The following three queries return the same results (order may be different).
  - ```sql
	SELECT a.ShipperName, CustomerID, EmployeeID, OrderID FROM Shippers a
	join Orders b
	on a.ShipperID = b.ShipperID
    ```
  - ```sql
	SELECT a.ShipperName, CustomerID, EmployeeID, OrderID FROM Shippers a
	Left join Orders b
	on a.ShipperID = b.ShipperID
    ```
  - ```sql
	SELECT b.ShipperName, CustomerID, EmployeeID, OrderID FROM Orders a
	Left join Shippers b
	on a.ShipperID = b.ShipperID
    ```

### The trick of **Left Join** and **IS NULL**

找出A table里的user_id且该user_id不在table B里

```sql
select A.id
from A 
left join B on A.id = B.id
where B.id IS NULL;
```
Note:

  - Use **IS NULL** instead of **=NULL**
  
### Count NULL and NOT NULL

```sql
SELECT COUNT(ID) as NotNull, SUM(CASE WHEN ID IS NULL then 1 else 0 end) as NullCount  
```

Note: 
  - count(columnname) does not count NULL

### Union

you have a table where you have date, user_id, song_id and count. It shows at the end of each day how many times in the history a user has listened to a given song. So count is cumulative sum. You have to update this on a daily basis based on a second table that records in real time when a user listens to a given song. Basically, at the end of each day, you go to this second table and pull a count of each user/song combination and then add this count to the first table that has the lifetime count. If it is the first time a user has listened to a given song, you won't have this pair in the lifetime table, so you have to create the pair there and then add the count of the last day.  
  - Table1: date, user_id, song_id, count. This is cumulative.
  - Table2: date, user_id, song_id, count. This is for each day
  - Using Table 2 to update Table1.

```sql
SELECT current_date, t.user_id, t.song_id, SUM(t.count)
FROM (
    SELECT *
    FROM cumu
    UNION ALL
    SELECT *
    FROM curr) t
GROUP BY t.user_id, t.song_id;
```

Note: 
  - use **UNION ALL** if the two tables have the same columns.
  - With **UNION**, only distinct values are selected.
  - The **UNION ALL** command is equal to the **UNION** command, except that **UNION ALL** selects all values.


### String Match

Write an SQL query to find names of employee start with 'A'?

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE EmpName like 'A%'
```

or end with 'A'
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE EmpName like '%A'
```

or 'A' in the second position
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE EmpName like '_A%'
```

Note:
  - '%' is used as a wild card with 'like'
  - '_' is used as one letter with 'like'
  
### Regular Expression

SQL regular expression very similar to python regular expression.

One example, find *LastName* begins with capital D:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees
where LastName regexp '^D'
```
**This one does not work in w3schools**

### Where vs Having

[Select the *EmployeeID* with the number of orders larger than 10 from **Orders**](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all)

```sql
SELECT EmployeeID, count(OrderID) FROM Orders
group by EmployeeID
having count(OrderID) > 10
```

Note:
  - “WHERE” vs “HAVING”: The WHERE clause cannot be used to restrict groups. The HAVING clause should be used.
  - “HAVING” need to be used after ‘GROUP BY’
  
#### [找出EmployeeID和所有对应的OrderID，EmployeeID有多于25的OrderID](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all)

```sql
SELECT a.EmployeeID, a.OrderID, b.cnt 
FROM Orders a
left join (
select EmployeeID, count(OrderID) as cnt
from Orders 
group by EmployeeID
) b
on a.EmployeeID = b.EmployeeID
where b.cnt > 25
Order by a.EmployeeID
```
or,

```sql
Select a.EmployeeID, a.OrderID From Orders a
Where a.EmployeeID in (
  Select b.EmployeeID From Orders b
  Group by b.EmployeeID
  Having count(b.OrderID) > 25
)
Order by a.EmployeeID, a.OrderID
```
  
### Most common elements in a column

[The most frequent *Quantity* in **OrderDetails**](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all)

```sql
select Quantity, max(cnt) from (
SELECT Quantity, count(Quantity) as cnt FROM [OrderDetails]
group by Quantity) a
```

Second most frequent *Quantity* in **OrderDetails**
```sql
select Quantity, max(cnt) from (
SELECT Quantity, count(Quantity) as cnt FROM [OrderDetails]
group by Quantity) a
where cnt not in (
select max(cnt) from (
SELECT Quantity, count(Quantity) as cnt FROM [OrderDetails]
group by Quantity)
)
```
or,
```sql
select Quantity, cnt from (
SELECT Quantity, count(Quantity) as cnt FROM [OrderDetails]
group by Quantity) a
order by cnt desc
limit 1 offset 1
```
or,
```sql
select Quantity, cnt from (
SELECT Quantity, count(Quantity) as cnt FROM [OrderDetails]
group by Quantity) a
where (select count(cnt) from (
SELECT Quantity, count(Quantity) as cnt FROM [OrderDetails]
group by Quantity) b where b.cnt >= a.cnt) = 2
```

Note:
  - one column table to two columns table:
    - one column, itself
	- second column, **count(itself)** with **group by itself**

### Accumulative Sum 

[Get the first *OrderDetailID* from which the accumulative number of orders larger than 80 from **OrderDetails**](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all)

```sql
select min(OrderDetailID), accsum from (
SELECT OrderDetailID, (select sum(Quantity) from OrderDetails b where b.OrderDetailID <= a.OrderDetailID) as accsum FROM OrderDetails a
)
where accsum > 80
```

or,
```sql
Select min(a.OrderDetailID) from OrderDetails a
where (select sum(Quantity) from OrderDetails b where b.OrderDetailID <= a.OrderDetailID) >= 80
```

Note:
  - Using self join
  - Using sum()
  - Pay attention to *<* or *<=* depending on question
  
### Count in range

Get the number of OrderDetailID with Quantity in 1-5, 6-10, 11-15, ... from OrderDetails
https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all

```sql
Select (grp+1)*5 as Range, count(OrderDetailID), sum(Quantity) from
(SELECT OrderDetailID, Quantity, ((Quantity - 1) / 5) as grp FROM [OrderDetails])
group by grp
```

Note: 
  - GROUP BY does not work on newly formed names, instead use the whole formula
  - Floor(Amount/50) or Ceil(Amount/50)
  
### Join After Group By

Compute average order / clicks for each visitor?

**click_data**

| visitor | dt | impression | clicks | test_variant |
| ------- | -- | ---------- | ------ | ------------ |
| a | 6/1 | 100 | 1 | control |
| b | 6/1 | 20 | 5 | control |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| aaa | 6/1 | 200 | 1 | treatment |
| bbb | 6/1 | 40 | 5 | treatment |

**purchase_data**

| visitor | dt | orders | $ | test_variant |
| ------- | -- | ------ | - | ------------ |
|     aa    |   6/2   |     1    |    100   |   control      |
|     bb    |   6/3   |     2    |    500   |   control      |
|    ...    |   ...   |    ...   |    ...   |    ...         |
|    aaaa   |   6/5   |     3    |   1000   |   treatment    | 
|    bbbb   |   6/10  |     1    |   200    |   treatment    |

```sql
select a.visitor, s_orders/sum(a.clicks) as each_avg
from click_data a
left join (
select visitor, sum(orders) as s_orders
from purchase_data b
group by visitor
) b
on a.visitor = b.visitor
group by a.visitor, s_orders
``` 

Note:
  - **sum() / sum()**, get one **sum()** in aggregation join sub query and then do another **sum()** in the main **select**

### Case ... When ... Then ... Else ... End

```sql
select top 100 date, 
count(*) as count_all,
sum (
  case 
    when content not like '%some condition%' then 1
	when content like '%some condition%' then -1
    else 0
  end
) as count_condition
from sections
group by date
order by date
```

Note:
  - Use ‘Case When … Then … Else … End’ when need to count two different conditions from one table
  
### cast( VAR as float)

给一个表有四个column：time, user_id, app_id, event ('imp' or 'click') 。大致意思：当一个user在玩一个app时，有一定几率会弹出一个窗口让user 添加信用卡（event "imp"），如果这个user按了 yes，那就是一个 click的event如何来判定这个弹窗口的效果？（click through rate），如何看哪个app click through rate最高，如何知道这个table的信息是否正确 （比如user 按了一次 yes，结果自动生成多次 click event）

```sql
select app_id, avg(rate) from (
select user_id, app_id, cast(count(case when event = 'click' then 1 else 0 end) as float) / cast(count(case when event = 'imp' then 1 else 0 end) as float) as rate
from table
group by user_id, app_id) sub
group by app_id
```

### Write an SQL query that makes recommendations using the pages that your friends liked. Assume you have two tables: a two-column table of users and their friends, and a two-column table of users and the pages they liked. It should not recommend pages you already like.

```sql 
select f.userid, l.pageid
from friends f
JOIN likes l ON l.userid = f.friendid
LEFT JOIN likes r ON (r.userid = f.userid AND r.pageid = l.pageid)
where r.pageid IS NULL;
```

Note: 

  - The trick of using **IS NULL** 
  - Whenever the question is something in table_a and not in table_b, use **'='** and **'IS NULL'**

### **Exists**

Find employee last name and first name who has more than 35 Orders (**count(OrderID) > 35**).
https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all

```sql
Select EmployeeID, LastName, FirstName from Employees a
where exists (
SELECT EmployeeID, count(OrderID) FROM [Orders] b
where b.EmployeeID = a.EmployeeID
group by EmployeeID
having count(OrderID) > 35)
```
  - Result: **4, Peacock, Margaret** 

Interpretation of this SQL Query:

  - ```sql
	SELECT EmployeeID, count(OrderID) FROM [Orders]
	where EmployeeID = 4
	group by EmployeeID
	having count(OrderID) > 35
    ```
	
    Result: **4, 40**. **where exists (...)** returns **True**.
	
  - ```sql
	SELECT EmployeeID, count(OrderID) FROM [Orders]
	where EmployeeID in (1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9)
	group by EmployeeID
	having count(OrderID) > 35
    ```
	
    No result. **where exists (...)** returns **False**.

Note:
  - There is a **Where** statement in the **EXISTS** subquery which connects the subquery with the main query. 
  - The **EXISTS** operator is used to test for the existence of any record in a subquery.
  - The **EXISTS** operator returns **True** if the subquery returns one or more records.
  - **EXISTS** is used to return a boolean value, **JOIN** returns a whole other table
  - **EXISTS** is only used to test if a subquery returns results, and short circuits as soon as it does.
  - **EXISTS** is a semi-join; **JOIN** is a join
  - **The columns in the Exists Subyquery can not be called in the main query.**

#### Tricky **Self Join** and Use **Not Exists**

Table: company

| Member_id | Company | Year_Start |
| --------- | ------- | ---------- |
| 1 | Microsoft | 2000 |
| 1 | Google | 2006 |
| 1 | Facebook | 2012 |
| 2 | Microsoft | 2001 |
| 2 | Oracle | 2004 |
| 2 | Google | 2007 |
| ... | ... | ... |

How many members ever moved from Microsoft to Google? (both member #1 and member #2 count)
 
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT c1.Member_id)
FROM company c1 
JOIN company c2
ON c1.Member_id = c2.Member_id 
WHERE c1.Company = 'Microsoft' 
AND c2.Company = 'Google'
AND c1.Year_Start < c2.Year_Start
```

How many members moved directly from Microsoft to Google? (Member 2 does not count since Microsoft -> Oracle -> Google)

```sql
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT c1.Member_id)
FROM company c1 
JOIN company c2
ON c1.Member_id = c2.Member_id 
WHERE c1.Company = 'Microsoft' 
AND c2.Company = 'Google'
AND c1.Year_Start < c2.Year_Start
LEFT JOIN company c3
ON c3.Member_id = c1.Member_id
WHERE c3.Year_Start BETWEEN c1.Year_Start AND c2.Year_Start
AND c3.Member_id IS NULL
```

or,
```sql
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT c1.Member_id)
FROM company c1 
JOIN company c2
ON c1.Member_id = c2.Member_id 
WHERE c1.Company = 'Microsoft' 
AND c2.Company = 'Google'
AND c1.Year_Start < c2.Year_Start
AND NOT EXISTS ( 
SELECT c3.Member_id
FROM company c3
WHERE c3.Member_id = c1.Member_id
AND c3.Year_Start BETWEEN c1.Year_Start AND c2.Year_Start
)
```

### Trick about Join and Count

一个log 数据表格 五列， Date, User_Id, Content_ID, Content_Type, Target_Id. Content_Type有5个，photo, post, share , like, comment. 其中post, photo, share 是story, like和comment是Action.

题目是问comment distribution by post.

```sql
Select Target_ID, count(Content_ID) as cnt
from table
where Content_Type = 'comment'
   and Target_ID in (select distinct Content_ID from table where Content_Type = 'post')
group by Target_ID
```
or,
```sql
Select post_id, count(comment_id)
from
(Select a.content_id as post_id, b.content_id as comment_id
From table a
Left join table b
On a.content_id = b.target_id
Where a.content_type =‘Post’
And b.content_type=‘Comment’
) sub
group by post_id
```

More directly:

```sql
Select a.content_id, count(b.user_id)
From content_actions a
Join content_actions b
On b.target_id = a.content_id
Where b.content_type = 'Comment'
And a.content_type = 'Post'
Group By a.content_id
```

Note: 
  - join two tables, on … and where a.column condition and b.column condition. Example as follows:
  https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all
  
```sql
SELECT a.OrderID, a.ShipperID, a.EmployeeID, b.Quantity
from Orders a
left join OrderDetails b
on a.OrderID = b.OrderID
where a.ShipperID = 1
and b.Quantity < 50
```

  - Directly count when join is the same as Count on a sub joined query:
  https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all
  
```sql  
SELECT ShipperName, Count(CustomerID) 
FROM Orders a
Join Shippers b
On a.ShipperID = b.ShipperID
Group By ShipperName
```

Same as,

```sql
Select ShipperName, Count(CustomerID)
From (
SELECT *, b.ShipperName 
FROM Orders a
Join Shippers b
On a.ShipperID = b.ShipperID
) sub
Group By ShipperName
```

### Order By Two Columns Differently and Aggregate

给一个table，studentid, courseid, grade, sql语句输出student最高成绩的一门课， 如果分数相同，输出courseid小的

```sql
select b.studentid, min(b.courseid), max(b.grade) from table b
join (
select studentid, max(grade) as grade from table c
group by studentid
) a
on a.studentid = b.studentid 
and a.grade = b.grade
group by b.studentid
```

Note: 
  - ```sql
    select studentid, min(courseid), max(grade) from table
    group by studentid
	```
	This does not work. min(courseid) will return the min of all the courseids in the studentid group and max(grade) will return the max of all the grades in studentid. This min and max are independent of each other.
  - ```sql
    select studentid, courseid, max(grade) from table
	group by studentid
    ``` 
	This does not work. As courseid is not in group by.
  - group by ShipperID, then max() select the max CustomerID row ordered according to EmployeeID in group ShipperID
  - EmployeeID is not in group by or aggregation count() or sum()

In MySQL,
```sql
SELECT studentid, courseid, grade
   FROM
     (SELECT studentid, courseid, grade, 
                  @student_rank := IF(@current_student = studentid, @student_rank + 1, 1) AS student_rank,
                  @current_student := studentid
       FROM table
       ORDER BY studentid, grade DESC
     ) ranked
   WHERE student_rank <= 1
```

In Orders, StudentID -> ShipperID, courseID -> EmployeeID, grade -> CustomerID
https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all

```sql
select b.ShipperID, min(b.EmployeeID), max(b.CustomerID) from Orders b
join (
select ShipperID, max(CustomerID) as CustomerID from Orders c
group by ShipperID
) a
on a.ShipperID = b.ShipperID 
and a.CustomerID = b.CustomerID
group by b.ShipperID
```

```sql
SELECT ShipperID, EmployeeID, CustomerID
   FROM
     (SELECT ShipperID, EmployeeID, CustomerID, 
                  @Shipper_rank := IF(@current_Shipper = ShipperID, @Shipper_rank + 1, 1) AS Shipper_rank,
                  @current_Shipper := ShipperID
       FROM Orders
       ORDER BY ShipperID, CustomerID DESC
     ) ranked
   WHERE Shipper_rank <= 1
```

### Sampling With rand()

Randomly select 100 records
```sql
select atg_id, map_id
from propensity
order by rand() 
LIMIT 10
```

or 
```sql
select atg_id, map_id
from propensity
distribute by rand()
sort by rand() 
LIMIT 10
```
